If a HTTP request contains no parameters, the appropriate web page is returned
The two subpages are returned only on the specific request "[ulr/IP]/c" (controling the outputs) and "[URL/IP]/s" (voltage reading and turning it off)
Otherwise the main page loading these subpages in a frame is returned.

The POST or GET Parameters (both work, so you can use simple wget commands or similar) are the following:

in all requests:
pwd     The password. If password protection is enabled, this needs to be correct for any other option to be considered

in requests from the /c page:
pwm1    The value to set the first pwm channel to. Value range: 0-1023 (only relevant if the current sequence is "-" or set to "-" in the same request)
seq1    The sequence to run for the first pwm channel. Values are any known sequences and "-" for no sequence to run but only the static pwm
pwm2    The value to set the second pwm channel to (0-1023, only relevant if the current sequence is "-" or set to "-" in the same request)
seq1    The sequence to run for the second pwm channel. Values are any known sequences and "-" for no sequence to run but only the static pwm
pwm3    The value to set the third pwm channel to (0-1023, only relevant if the current sequence is "-" or set to "-" in the same request)
seq1    The sequence to run for the third pwm channel. Values are any known sequences and "-" for no sequence to run but only the static pwm

pin1    If pin1=1 passed, the appropriate output will turn on for a (very) short time
pin2    If pin2=1 passed, the appropriate output will turn on for a (very) short time

alloff  If alloff=1 is passed, all outputs are turned off, all 

in requests for the /s page:
off    if off=1 is passed, the module turns itself off


A sample wget command should be:
wget node-XXXX/c?pwm1=300&seq3=tease&pin2=1&pwd=mypassword
wget node-XXXX/s?off=1&pwd=mypassword


ESPWIFI.conf file format
each line starting with a # character is considered a comment
each other line needs to be of the format
SSID=password
the first SSID=password pair is used for the WiFi accesspoint (enter any ssid/password pair if you don't use the accesspoint)
any further line SSID=password line is used foconnecting to wifis having this ssid

ESPServer.conf file format
each line starting with a # character is considered a comment
each other line needs to be of the format
parameter=value
see ESPServer.conf sample files to see the needed parameters (English and German, the comments will help you understanding each entry)



Sequence file format:

first line tells:
pwmsequence

each further line defines the pwm value (0-1023) which will be set for the next period of x miliseconds 
e.g.:
1023, 4000
or
177, 2374
or
0, 100


last line:
repeat=infinite
for infinite repeat of the sequence (until another sequence gets activated), or
repeat, 1
to just run the sequence once (turns off when done or another sequence gets activated)
